            <p>
                Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was an
                American businessman, inventor, and investor best known for
                co-founding the technology company Apple Inc. Jobs was also the
                founder of NeXT and chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar.
                He was a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the
                1970s and 1980s, along with his early business partner and
                fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. <br />
                <br />

                Jobs was born in San Francisco in 1955 and adopted shortly
                afterwards. He attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing
                that same year. In 1974, he traveled through India, seeking
                enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak
                co-founded Apple in 1976 to further develop and sell Wozniak's
                Apple I personal computer. Together, the duo gained fame and
                wealth a year later with production and sale of the Apple II,
                one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers.
                Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979,
                which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI).
                This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in
                1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first
                mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh launched the
                desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the
                Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector
                graphics and PostScript. <br />
                <br />

                In 1985, Jobs departed Apple after a long power struggle with
                the company's board and its then-CEO, John Sculley. That same
                year, Jobs took some Apple employees with him to found NeXT, a
                computer platform development company that specialized in
                computers for higher-education and business markets, serving as
                its CEO. In 1986, he helped develop the visual effects industry
                by funding the computer graphics division of Lucasfilm that
                eventually spun off independently as Pixar, which produced the
                first 3D computer-animated feature film Toy Story (1995) and
                became a leading animation studio, producing over 27 films
                since. <br />
                <br />

                In 1997, Jobs returned to Apple as CEO after the company's
                acquisition of NeXT. He was largely responsible for reviving
                Apple, which was on the verge of bankruptcy. He worked closely
                with British designer Jony Ive to develop a line of products and
                services that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning with
                the "Think different" advertising campaign, and leading to the
                iMac, iTunes, Mac OS X, Apple Store, iPod, iTunes Store, iPhone,
                App Store, and iPad. In 2003, Jobs was diagnosed with a
                pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. He died of tumor-related
                respiratory arrest in 2011; in 2022, he was posthumously awarded
                the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

                Family
            </h2>
            <hr />

            Steven Paul Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, on February
            24, 1955, to Joanne Carole Schieble and Abdulfattah "John" Jandali
            (Arabic: عبد الفتاح الجندلي). Abdulfattah Jandali was born in a
            Muslim household to wealthy Syrian parents, the youngest of nine
            siblings. After obtaining his undergraduate degree at the American
            University of Beirut, Jandali pursued a PhD in political science at
            the University of Wisconsin. There, he met Joanne Schieble, an
            American Catholic of Swiss-German descent whose parents owned a mink
            farm and real estate in Green Bay. The two fell in love but faced
            opposition from Schieble's father due to Jandali's Muslim faith.
            When Schieble became pregnant, she arranged for a closed adoption,
            and travelled to San Francisco to give birth.[3] <br />
            <br />

            Schieble requested that her son be adopted by college graduates. A
            lawyer and his wife were selected, but they withdrew after
            discovering that the baby was a boy, so Jobs was instead adopted by
            Paul Reinhold and Clara (née Hagopian) Jobs. Paul Jobs, an American
            of German descent, was the son of a dairy farmer from Washington
            County, Wisconsin. After dropping out of high school, he worked as a
            mechanic, then joined the US Coast Guard.
            <br />
            <br />
            When his ship was decommissioned at San Francisco, he bet he could
            find a wife within two weeks. He then met Clara Hagopian, an
            American of Armenian descent, and the two were engaged ten days
            later, in March 1946, and married that same year. The couple moved
            to Wisconsin, then Indiana, where Paul Jobs worked as a machinist
            and later as a car salesman. Since Clara missed San Francisco, she
            convinced Paul to move back. There, Paul worked as a repossession
            agent, and Clara became a bookkeeper. In 1955, after having an
            ectopic pregnancy, the couple looked to adopt a child.[3] Since they
            lacked a college education, Schieble initially refused to sign the
            adoption papers, and went to court to request that her son be
            removed from the Jobs household and placed with a different family,
            but changed her mind after Paul and Clara promised to pay for their
            son's college tuition.
